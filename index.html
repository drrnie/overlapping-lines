	<h2>State your mind.</h2>   
	<ul>
		<li>You're just "sad"</li>
		<li>You lack "faith" and that "religion" will be your "salvation"</li>
		<li>Nag-iinarte lang (This hurts the most)</li>
		<li>"IT'S NOTHING, SOME PEOPLE HAVE IT WORSE"</li>
		<li>It's your fault that you're letting it affect you</li>
		<li>Nobody cares until someone commits suicide, then they blame the person who died for committing suicide.</li>

    <p>Y ou ever wonder what it's like to be the counterweight to your own self? It's this paradox that hits you straight in the face like a gazelle going a hundred miles an hour. It screws you up until you're nothing but the shell of what you used to be. But you might say, "Calm down a minute, Darren. What on earth are you talking about?" I'm talking about self-destruction. And not the kind that ends instantly with a click, I'm talking about that slow, decaying process of losing grasp on everything, resulting in very high self expectations and low self-esteem. Depression? I'd say yes. The warlord of the heathens of mental health. Silent killer. It'll come for everybody, and the worst part is that most people don't even recognize its existence.</p>
	<h3>What must be done?</h3>
	<p>R aise awareness, which is the hardest thing to do especially because not everybody can see your pain, and there are even some toxic people that will mock you for feeling that way in the first place. Or you could find someone to rely on and run to them, full speed.</p>
	<h3>Am I going to be okay?</h3>
	<p>Y es. But this is an answer that is hard to depend on. After all, optimism is just masked anxiety.</p>
